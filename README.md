# Solana Paper Wallet with Staking

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to create a Solana paper wallet and a stake account controlled by the paper wallet. All sensitive operations are performed on an air-gapped computer to ensure the seed phrases and private keys remain offline. Transactions are constructed using offline signing via the Solana CLI, and the paper wallet is designed for easy recovery with software wallet apps. This guide assumes a Linux environment.
